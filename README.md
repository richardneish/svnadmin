# Subversion Admin Tool

## Introduction
**SVNAdmin** is a web application designed to allow administrators to manage access to [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) repositories.  The design philosophy is

* Use the same authorisation file used by the Subversion server, and allow editing of the file outside of this tool.
* Allow delegation of administration for each repository.
* Support both file-based users and LDAP / Active Directory based users.
* Run on both Linux and Windows servers (probably others, have only tested these two).

See the [documentation](/doc/index.html) for details.
